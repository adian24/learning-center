## Notes

### Current State
The certificate system foundation is already well-implemented with:
- Complete database schema
- Comprehensive API routes
- Authentication system
- PDF generation service
- React hooks for certificate management

### Main Work Required
- Create frontend pages for certificate display
- Implement public certificate access
- Enhance PDF generation with better library
- Add UI/UX improvements for better user experience

### Risk Mitigation
- Existing API routes provide solid foundation
- Database schema is already optimized
- Authentication system is proven
- PDF generation system is functional (just needs enhancement)

This implementation builds upon existing solid foundations and focuses on completing the user-facing features and enhancements.
